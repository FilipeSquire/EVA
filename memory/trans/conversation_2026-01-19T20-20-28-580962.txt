            "content": "Here\u2019s a concise, up-to-date overview of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nWhat it is\n- Cyberpunk 2077 is a first\u2011person, open\u2011world action RPG from CD Projekt Red, set in the neon-soaked Night City of 2077. You play as V, a customizable mercenary whose fate becomes intertwined with a bio-chip containing the engram (digital copy) of legendary rocker Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves). The game blends gunplay, hacking, cyberware, and grandiose storytelling in a large, living city. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077?utm_source=openai))\n\nCore ideas and features\n- Lifepaths: At the start you pick one of three backgrounds\u2014Street Kid, Nomad, or Corpo\u2014which shape your early encounters and dialogue without locking you out of the main story. Each path leads into Night City with its own flavor and opportunities. ([gamespot.com](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-life-path-guide-should-you-pick-street-kid-corpo-or-nomad/1100-6485317/?utm_source=openai))\n- Character progression and cyberware: The game lets you customize V\u2019s skills, gear, and implants, and you can upgrade weapons, vehicles, and cyberware to fit your playstyle. The system has evolved over patches to better balance combat and customization. ([cyberpunk.net](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/49060/update-2-0?utm_source=openai))\n- Endings and choices: Your decisions throughout the main quest can lead to different endings and varies in how characters react to you, with Night City feeling differently depending on your actions. (This is a long\u2011running feature of the game and is discussed in coverage of its narrative.) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077?utm_source=openai))\n\nNotable updates and expansions (recent history)\n- Phantom Liberty (expansion, 2023): A major spy\u2011thriller expansion set in a new Night City district called Dogtown. It adds a fresh questline, new characters (including Idris Elba\u2019s Solomon Reed), a new Relic skill tree, higher level cap, new weapons/vehicles, and more. It released on September 26, 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. ([cyberpunk.net](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/48265/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-arrives-on-september-26th?utm_source=openai))\n- Update 2.0 (2023): A sweeping, free overhaul of many systems\u2014redesigned skill trees and perks, revamped cyberware, vehicle combat and police systems, AI tuning, and more. It dramatically reshaped how you play and progress. ([press.cdprojektred.com](https://press.cdprojektred.com/news/1393/update-2-0-for-cyberpunk-2077-is-now-available?utm_source=openai))\n- Ultimate Edition and later patches: The Ultimate Edition bundled Phantom Liberty with the base game and updates; post\u2011launch patches have continued to add content and improvements (for example, 2.2\u20132.3 patches adding new quests, AutoDrive for vehicles, VRR support, etc.). 2.3 in particular brought AutoDrive and Delamain taxi service, plus broader platform\u2011level enhancements. ([gematsu.com](https://www.gematsu.com/2023/11/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-launches-december-5-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc?utm_source=openai))\n\nRecent and ongoing relevance (as of January 2026)\n- Platform reach and new ports: After the big 2020 launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has seen continued platform expansion, including upgrades for next\u2011gen hardware and later ports (e.g., Mac/Apple silicon and Switch 2 variants) with ongoing patches to improve performance and features. Patch notes and official announcements document these changes. ([cyberpunk.net](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/49060/update-2-0?utm_source=openai))\n- Continued content and cross\u2011media impact: The Netflix anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (2022) gave a substantial popularity boost, contributing to renewed sales and player interest in the game. The show\u2019s impact on sales and concurrent players has been widely reported by outlets like Forbes and Kotaku. ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/cyberpunk-2077s-playercount-is-up-nearly-300-thanks-to-edgerunners/?utm_source=openai))\n- Sequel and ongoing development: CD Projekt Red has publicly discussed a follow\u2011up project (often referred to as Cyberpunk 2) and has continued to expand the Cyberpunk universe with stories and ancillary media while Phantom Liberty remains a high\u2011point of the current game\u2019s lifecycle. ([windowscentral.com](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-pre-production-phantom-liberty-10-million?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you\u2019re deciding to jump in\n- For a spoiler\u2011free sense: Expect a gritty, big\u2011budget RPG with a strong focus on character customization, choice, and a city that truly feels alive (even if it\u2019s rough around the edges at first release, thanks to major patches).\n- For a deeper dive: I can tailor a guide to your preferred platform (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Mac, Switch 2), or break down specifics like best early builds, how lifepaths influence early quests, or which patches/expansions to prioritize.\n\nWould you like a spoiler\u2011free starter build guide, a quick rundown of the three lifepaths, or a timeline of the major patches and expansions with release dates?"
